        <p>As referenced from DIT prospectus, the Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) is located in the Dar es Salaam city centre, at the junction of Morogoro Road and Bibi Titi Mohamed Street. DIT was established in 1997 by the Act of Parliament, “the DIT Act No.6 of 1997” to replace the Dar es Salaam Technical College, which had a long history of technical training in Tanzania. This history dates back to 1957 when its predecessor; the Dar es Salaam Technical Institute was established aiming at providing vocational training in the country. The Institute later expanded its scope to offer technical secondary school courses and training for Technical Assistants before it was upgraded in 1962 to become the Dar es Salaam Technical College (DTC), the first formal technical training institution in the country.  
            One of the responsibilities of DTC was to train technicians under the London City and Guilds Training Program. In order to enhance its contribution to the national capacity building in technical manpower, the College in 1964 introduced two-and-a-half-year Ordinary Technician Diploma (OTD) programmes in Civil, Electrical, Telecommunications and Mechanical Engineering. These were later upgraded into three-year Full Technician Certificate (FTC) courses in 1970/1.  
            Later, the College also introduced Diploma in Engineering (DE) programmes in the four traditional engineering disciplines to provide post-FTC technical training. Courses for Laboratory Technology and Diploma in Technical Education (DTE) were also introduced. The position of DTC in the provision of higher technical education was consolidated in 1991 when the corresponding Advanced Diploma in Engineering (ADE) programmes replaced the Diploma in Engineering (DE) courses. Today, DE and ADE graduates can be found in almost all engineering firms/institutions. There is positive feedback from the respective employers indicating overall good performance by ADE graduates.  
            The current political and economic trends, as well as the new technological changes have increased competition in the demand for, and supply of quality products including technical education and services. Under such a competitive environment, the leading position of DTC in the provision of higher technical education could not be sustained for long given its old set-up and mission. Hence a new institution was therefore necessary to replace the Dar es Salaam Technical College. Such an institution could effectively address the current technological developments, provide competitive academic outputs in terms of quality technical training, applied research and expertise services to the community. The Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology was therefore established in 1997 to realize that aspiration, as guided by its vision and mission. </p>
